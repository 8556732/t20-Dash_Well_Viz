# t20-Dash_Well_Viz

## Introduction
The aim is to try and build some interactive log visualisations using dash in notebooks and demonstrate what is possible (and also what the limitations are) using dash on subsurface data. 

Ultimately it would be good to try and collate all the examples into a library of templates to share after the Hackathon swung.


## Ideas
- Log shading (edge to curve, curve to curve, curve to edge) - fixed colour and variable colour?
- CPI / CompLog type displays
- Seismic trace displays (wiggle, density) - fixed colour and variable colour?
- Well tie displays (Vp Vs Rho - AI PR) plus seismic traces
- VSP displays
- Point displays & Cross plots (point data)
- Interval logs - lithology columns, facies etc
- Well log QC & cross plots
- Display of 'live' data in well (ie highlight missing log intervals)
